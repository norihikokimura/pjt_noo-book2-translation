I start with an overivew of a scientific questions. Throughout the natural world, one sees myriad examples of systems which "come into being." Indeed, as we think about it, in natural systems there is nothing else BUT this "coming into being." Everything is coming into being, continuously.

Yet we have relatively little theory that allows us to grasp this process of coming into being. Although there have been many discussions in the last twho decades about chaos, catastrophes, bifuracation, and emergence, about the generation of known as chaos theory, and the way that new structures emerge by differentiation and bifuracation, still, even now, there is not enough coherent scientific theory that tell us how these processes really work geometrically.

In the first four chaptersI focus on the idea that a living process always has enormous respect for the state (and morphology and form) of what exists, and always finds a next step forward which preserves the structure of what exists, and develops and extends its latent structure as it creates change, or evolution, or development. This is the process which is "creative."

In chapters 1 and 2, I address these issues for cases in the natural world, and provide the outline of a tentative approach that helps us understand the unfolding of geometry in biology and physics. This theory provides the underpinning for what follows. In chapter 3 and 4, I turn my attention to the BUILT world, to towns and buildings and to the way the emergence of living structure in towns and buildings may be understood within the context of theory.

The searchlight on nature will show us that many of the processes we have come to accept as normal in architecture and city planning and development are, form a process point of view, deeply flowed, They are, as matters stand today, incapable in principle of generating living structure. For this reason the near absence of living structure in our built contemporary world cannot be a surprise to us. It follows, inevitably, from the flaws of the processes we have come to accept as normal part of our society, and it will change when the process we use in our society, are changed.

# CHAPTER ONE: THE PRINCIPLE OF UNFOLDING WHOLENESS IN NATURE

***

## 1/ INTRODUCTION

How does nature create living structure?

Living structure, as I have defined it, is not merely the structure we find in living creatures –– organisms and other ecological and biological systems. It is, in a more general sense, the character of all that we perceive as “nature.” The living structure is the general morphological character which natural phenomena have in common.

In Book I, I have tried to describe and characterize this living structure in very general terms. In the sense introduced in Book I, the living centers which appear in any given physical system have varying degrees of life. They have life because they are composed of other living centers that support and sustain and intensify each other. I remind the reader that in this way of thinking, living structure refers not to the biological systems in the world, but is a general character, appearing through all systems, organic and inorganic, of the natural world.

The way that centers manage to support and intensify each other in such living structure is chiefly governed by the repeated occurrence of fifteen geometric properties defined in Book 1<!--1-->. They are identified as: 1. LEVELS OF SCALE, 2. STRONG CENTERS, 3. BOUNDARIES, 4. ALTERNATING REPETITION, 5. POSITIVE SPACE, 6. GOOD SHAPE, 7. LOCAL SYMMETRIES, 8. DEEP INTERLOCK AND AMBIGUITY, 9. CONTRAST, Io. GRADIENTS, II. ROUGHNESs, I2. ECHOEs, I3. THE VOID, I4. SIMPLICITY AND INNER CALM, 15. NOT-SEPARATENESS.

What I call the living structure of nature –– that which we see in the natural world around us — is also largely governed by these fifteen properties and their interaction and superposition. Chapter 6 of Book I contains many examples that show the field of centers and its associated fifteen properties in rocks, animals, plants, clouds, rivers, landscapes, crystals. Again and again, throughout the worlds studied in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, fluid dynamics, ecology, crystallography, cytology, and molecular biology, we find densely packed structures of centers in which thousands of centers support each other<!--2-->. Thus nature creates living structure every day, in sand, in rivers, in clouds, in birds, in running antelopes. It does it, both in the organic and inorganic realms, apparently without effort.

But why does living structure, with its multiplicity of centers and their associated fifteen properties, keep making its appearance in the natural world? _Why_, and _how_, does living structure keep recurring in these widely different domains? What is the mechanics of the process by which living structure is made to appear, so easily, in nature? What is the process by which this kind of structure repeatedly, and persistently, occurs?

Oddly enough, the persistent appearance of living structure in nature is not easy to explain. That is why, in this book about architecture, I start by trying to understand nature in a new way. Once we have that understanding, we may have a basis for thinking about architectural process and for identifying processes which are capable of creating a living world in the realm of architecture. In a good building, as in nature, there is also living structure. Each living center contains thousands of living centers; and the centers support each other in an intricate pattern. But as we see from the many 20th-century buildings which lack this structure, there is – at least in modern society– some kind of immense practical difficulty in creating such a living structure in the real world of buildings. Indeed, the very large number of recently built buildings which lack living structure suggests that for some reason it is especially hard for us in our present period of history.

Yet nature manages the task rather easily. That is why I say, “To learn how to create living structure in buildings, we had better start by looking at nature.”

## 2/ NOTE FOR THE SCIENTIFIC READER

In what follows, I shall argue that the emergence of new structure in nature, is brought about, always, by a sequence of transformations which act on the whole, and in which each step emerges as a discernible and continuous result from the immediately preceding whole.

This thought, obvious if taken naively, but profound and difficult if taken literally as a piece of science, relies entirely on the possibility that we can form a coherent and well-defined idea of what is meant by “the whole,” and of what is meant by a structure which grows from the whole, and preserves the wholeness while it is moving forward. Such a thought is well-nigh impossible today, because in spite of the uses provided by David Bohm of the word “wholeness,” there is in science today no concise or well-defined idea of wholeness as a structure. Yet without a well-defined idea of the whole, the thought I have expressed here cannot be completed or used. The nub of the point which governs the thinking of this book, is that we _are_ able to approach clear thinking about this issue, and have enough of a well-defined formulation of what wholeness “is”to see the outline of a new theory built on this foundation.

Although I cannot claim to have fully solved the problem, I believe that in Book I, I have given a sufficient description and definition of “the wholeness” so that it may be understood as a well-defined structure which occurs in all configurations.

Briefly, recapitulating passages of Book I, the wholeness is what we think of as the “gestalt,” the broad gestural sweep of a figure, or of a configuration. In the Belousov reaction (images shown on page 27 below), it is the “curly-Y” figure –– the lily-shaped figure — which has two halves sweeping away from each other, and containing between them a V-shaped center. That is what exists in picture 2, and what exists, already, in an earlier form, in picture 1. The 2nd stage has emerged from this wholeness, and has preserved it, even as it introduces other structure. In the stages 2 and 3, we see another gestalt, which emerged from the first –– a pair of round whorls or spirals –– partly present in the picture 2, and fully developed in picture 3. As we go from picture to picture, or from stage to stage of the reaction, we see a continuous series of such configurations, in which the deep gestalt of each stage forms, grows, swells, develops, and gives rise to a new configuration.

It is this process, which I mean by “emergence of the wholeness” and by “emergence of the configuration from the wholeness.”

What I have said, in Book I, is that this wholeness is in principle amenable to mathematical treatment and description. A wholeness consists of a recursively nested system of centers, all more or less living ones (according to the definitions of Book 1). It displays the fifteen properties, and in a sense one might say that the fifteen properties are the primitive configurations from which all wholeness is built. In more detail still, considering the arguments and examples of Book I, appendix 3, the wholeness may always be viewed as a nested system of local symmetries, and it is the _configuration_ of the system of nested local symmetries which gives us the character of any particular wholeness, in any particular configuration.

I claim that even in continuous phenomena (such as curves, curved surfaces, organic forms in three dimensions such as leaves or organs, or in configurations of subtle gestalt such as gradients and smoothly meandering curves) _it is always the wholeness, as defined here_, in terms of the strong centers which appear, and in terms of local symmetries, which provide the handle of this wholeness.
***
20  
What I call the wholeness is, to a very rough degree, a mathematical representation of the overall gestalt which we perceive, or which we are aware, which gives the character to the configuration, and which forms, what an artist might call, his most intuitive apperception of the whole.

Now, in simple outline, what I claim in this chapter, and in many succeeding chapters, is that natural process — and all living processes — come about as a result of sequence of transformations which emerge from, and act upon, this wholeness — bearing in mind that the wholeness is a well-defined thing, not an artistic thing — and that it is indeed from this wholeness, not previously identified in science with precision, that all growth and morphology emerge.

And yet I must apologize. Although I have given a nearly adequate definition of what this means, I have not given precise enough treatment, yet, to provide a strict mathematical treatment. What follows then, should be understood as proto-mathematics, where a structural idea, mathematical in principle, is available, and may guide our thought — but the hard work of formulating a mathematics with which one can calculate, has only just begun.

With this shortcoming in mind, please regard the following discussion, and presentation of examples, with some forgiveness. I have come as close to being accurate as, at present, I know how.

## 3/ THE NEED FOR A GENERAL EXPLANATION, OF THE WAY THAT LIVING STRUCTURE IS CREATED

When we look at nature, we can nearly always find an explanation for any _one_ of the fifteen properties as it appears in any _one_ particular instance. Take BOUNDARIES, for example. Conventional plasma physics can be used to explain the appearance of the plasma boundary layer that forms around the sun. Hydrodynamics can be used to explain the silting up of the mouth of a river like the Rio Negro, where it flows into the Amazon, to form a pattern of streams bounded by great swaths of silted mud deposited by stream flow. Biological studies suggest why a cell is constructed to have a thick boundary layer, larger in volume than the nucleus of the cell. It is needed as the zone where chemical exchanges happen.

But it is quite another matter to give a general explanation which tells us why massive and substantial boundaries _will in general, tend to occur again and again, throughout nature, within three dimensional systems_. This question involves a level of morphological thinking which has no familiar language in contemporary mathematics.

I have argued in Book I that the fifteen properties are necessarily associated with living centers and are the ways in which centers appear in the world, come to life, and cooperate to form other living centers. But that, in itself, does not explain why they keep appearing. We need a more systematic, general explanation. It is extremely hard to formulate a general rule for any one of the fifteen properties which gives us a convincing explanation as to why that property appears again and again and again throughout nature.  

This issue is far from trivial. Although recent developments in complexity theory have shown how linked systems of variables, under the right conditions, will cooperate to form emergent order, that in itself does not yet tell us why the particular kind of order formation I have identified as living structure, keeps on recurring, time after time<!--3-->.
***
21
Yet there does, in an enormous number of empirical cases, appear to be a process which produces centers –– and above all “living centers” –– packed with density of other centers and hence with life. Why do _these living centers_ appear? Why does living structure appear in the world? What is it –– in the detailed history of natural systems, with its mechanical causation –– that can, step by step, keep on making the fifteen properties appear in general, and that therefore, _in general_, causes the repeated creation of living structure in the inorganic and organic world?"<!--4-->

>Boundary formed by cytological process in a mammalian cell

## 4/ CREATION OF STRUCTURE AS IT OCCURS IN NATURE

In what follows, I invite the reader to look at examples, while considering the existence of a fundamental principle which I call the principle of _unfolding wholeness_. This principle states that, _in the evolution of an otherwise undisturbed system, the wholeness W is progressively enhanced and intensified_. This wholeness, as defined in chapter 3 of Book 1, is the system of strong centers which occurs in space<!--5-->.

According to this principle, the transformations which occur in the system take whatever wholeness exists at any given instant and continue it and intensify it while, broadly, maintaining its global structure, so that at the next instant that wholeness is more pronounced; as time goes for ward, the wholeness gets progressively intensified, step by step by step. It is this process — I maintain — which is responsible for the creation of living structure. When the wholeness is intensified again and again, precisely that structure we recognize as living (with its fifteen properties) will begin to appear. In this view, then, the appearance of living structure in the world is caused by the repeated application of the principle of unfolding wholeness to every system.


I believe the principle of unfolding wholeness is consistent with most present-day physics and biology. It is also consistent with recent thinking in non-linear dynamics, catastrophe theory, and bifurcation theory<!--6-->. It is, however, a principle which is not automatically given by anything currently identified in these disciplines. As such, it is a new principle, necessary, I believe, in order to explain the appearance of living structure in the world.

If we examine the wide variety of cases from nature which I present in the next few pages, we shall see that they all show a particular kind of structure-preserving, smooth unfolding. That is true, even when systems pass through bifurcations and catastrophes. In each case, there is a path of development that is notable for being smoothly structure-preserving in a way that keeps the global structure intact. In the terms I have defined in Book I, it is _wholeness_ which exhibits smooth unfolding<!--7-->. That is, the structure I have defined as the wholeness, as it changes from state to state over time, follows a path where the centers which constitute the wholeness (and particularly the large ones) are changing as little as possible. The wholeness is essentially pre served at each step, and the new structure is introduced in such a way that it maintains and extends — but almost never violates –– the existing structure. It is globally structure-preserving. That is why the unfolding seems smooth.

In the following pages I illustrate sequences for such processes in the following cases:  

Formation of a spiral galaxy.  
The formation of a frog embryo.  
A breaking wave in the ocean.  
Formation of a milk-drop splash.   
Formation of vortices on the surface of Jupiter.  
Evolution of different beaks in subspecies of Hawaiian finches.  
Flight of a pigeon.  
The sequence of the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction.  
Evolution of mollusks.  
Formation of a plane surface on a growing crystal.  
Development of algae.  
Stages of development of a common mushroom.  
Bacterial growth.
***
23  
Collapse of a smooth cylinder under buckling.  
Growth of quasi-crystals in alloys.  
Formation of a planetary moon.  
Generation of slime mold.  
A glass plate shattering.  

Other examples are scattered in the text which follows in this chapter and the next.  

Sand waves forming in wind-blown sand.  
Growth of a snow crystal.  
Evolution of a river bed.  
Development of an angiosperm seed.  
Evolution of the feathers of archaeopteryx.  
The quantum process which creates electron orbits within atoms.  

In all these cases, when we look at the sequence of development, we see a sequence which is essentially _smooth_ in character<!--8-->. That means, within the sequence, _each state follows, without breaking structure, from the state before_. The structure of the state before (its wholeness) develops, evolves, changes — but is still visible in the next state. Even in those important cases where an entirely new structure is introduced — often the most important moments in the sequence — the new structure is still introduced in such a way as to maintain the essence, the underlying structure, of the previous state. This smoothness of evolution is visible in all the examples, essentially without exception. Even in those cases where there is a catastrophe –– the mathematical term for the appearance of some new feature, not visible in the symmetries of the previous state — this catastrophe always begins as a feature _which is essentially consistent with the symmetries of the earlier state_, and which then develops, and continues to develop, as the new source of structure, thus still allowing a smooth and consistent evolution of structure<!--9-->.

##### FORMATION OF A SPIRAL GALAXY – THE DRAMATIC SPIRALS OF M51

The genesis of the spiral form in a galaxy comes about because a disk of pre-galactic material, spinning as it does, includes some random motion. The random perturbations give rise to an oscillating pattern of gravitational waves of rarefaction and compression. As this wave system develops, it can go only to two or three large-scale forms. Much of the time, it goes to a two-armed spiral. The two-armed spiral is one of the simplest transforms of a slightly perturbed oscillating disk of material in which a gravitational wave appears<!--10-->.The second illustration shows a computer simulation of the process. When you break the infinite symmetry group of the rotating disk, you are left with the simplest symmetry group consistent with rotational motion: a spiral with arms.

>The spiral galaxy M51

>Computer simulation of the process of the emergence of the spiral in a galaxy. At each step, we see a smooth transition from the previous state, preserving most of the structure of the wholeness of the previous state.

***
24
##### A BRAKING WAVE IN THE OCEAN

Here we have a catastrophe creating radical new structure. When the wave breaks, the smooth, curved top of the unbroken wave slowly becomes a point, and this point then curls over when the wave breaks. Finally, the broken wave turns into many drops which form the splash.

Even here, when the curve turns into a cusp with a sharp point, only one new differentiation is introduced. The system of centers which existed in the volume of the water, on the air-water interface and next to the water in the air, are, for the most part, maintained. One small bit of new structure is added — the cusp –– and this tiny bit of structure, gradually introduced and extended, becomes more and more extensive in its impact, and finally makes the wave break, and forms an entirely new system of configurations.

In each case, if we look carefully at Thom's diagram, and at my diagram to the right, we see that the system of centers which constitutes the wholeness in the ongoing wave is extended and maintained and developed, but never violated<!--11-->.

##### THE FORMATION OF A FROG EMBRYO

The embryo starts as a ball of cells. The ball splits down the middle. An axis is introduced. The wholeness of each stage is consistent with the wholeness of the previous stage.  

>A breaking wave

>René Thom's diagram of a breaking wave, showing the smooth appearance of the catastrophe

>Gradual change of centers as the wave breaks

***
25  
The centers which exist in the wholeness at each stage — both large centers dominating the big pattern, and small ones locally — are largely left intact by the next transformation. The next transformation introduces new structure, usually in the form of new asymmetrically placed _local_ symmetries which induce new layers of structure — hence a new differentiation — but rarely or never disperse the underlying deep structure of the old, even when it changes things<!--12-->.

##### EVOLUTION OF A SPLASHING DROP

Although this splashing drop sequence shows the appearance of a new structure (which is in mathematical terms catastrophic because new features appear in a non-continuous fashion from old features) what is important is that nevertheless, once again, the actual transitions are still smooth. In the photographs above, the change from one frame to the next is always gentle<!--13-->.

26
##### FORMATION OF VORTICES ON THE SURFACE OF JUPITER

In the photograph, we see a complex system of vortices on the surface of Jupiter.

The diagrams show a much simplified but similar system. Below are shown four stages in a computer simulation of dynamical appearance of vortices from a smooth laminar flow in a simple system similar in general type to the vortices on Jupiter. If we look at the transition from stage to stage in the simulation, at each stage we see a comprehensible and relatively modest transition. Although the last stage is markedly different from the first, the transition from each stage to the succeeding one is morphologically smooth. Stage 1 of the system is a double wavy line. Stage 2 maintains the wavy undulation, but introduces whorls and S-shapes which roughly preserve the undulating form. In Stage 3, the complex alternating S-shapes collapse to form separated double whorls, while losing the binding S-shapes. In stage 4, the pairs of whorls collapse further to coalesce in a single S, which nevertheless preserves the doublet form of the previous stage. At each step, the wholeness structure is preserved, though extended, each time changing in overall quality, but largely without losing the global structure present in the previous stage — even while new structure is being created<!--14-->.

##### EVOLUTION OF DIFFERENT BEAKS IN SUBPECIES OF HAWAIIAN FINCHES

Here we see an example from the evolution of species: a family of finches in their conjectured evolutionary sequence. In this instance, for the first time, we have a case where it is not the wholeness _itself_ which is unfolding in the sequence shown, but rather the genome which gives birth to a sequence of different wholenesses. The wholeness in each finch is generated by the genes in the embryo, interacting with the biological environment as the embryo grows. This genetic structure is also a kind of wholeness, but a _latent_ wholeness, contained within each bird in its genetic material. This latent wholeness, capable of generating the wholeness of the bird, itself also evolves and is transformed by transformations much like those that go from one wholeness to another. In evolutionary time, the system smoothly moves from the wholeness created by one genetic sequence to another wholeness, far separated in time. What is evolving smoothly, behind the scenes, is the wholeness latent in the genetic material of these different finches<!--15-->.

In the diagram, we see displayed the evolution of the different subspecies.  

>Similar vortices on the surface of Jupiter

>Computer simulations: step-wise evolution of vortices from laminar stream flow

***
27  
Starting at the bottom of the picture and moving upward through the evolutionary tree, we see how, in the process of evolution, the transitions from species to species are once again smooth and structure-preserving. Even though the variation of different beaks is great, the transitions from one to the next are always “nice”<!--16-->.

##### FLIGHT OF A PIGEON

Here we see the same smoothness in steps that are only microseconds apart. Each stage and configuration –– of the bird's flight follow smoothly from the previous one. In each state, we see the wholeness of the previous state, almost entirely preserved as a structure, with insertion of a minor modification on the whole. Although the motion passes through phases, utterly unlike each other, from step to step there are no abrupt transitions<!--17-->.

##### THE SEQUENCE OF THE BELOUSOVZHABOTINSKI REACTION: CHEMICAL SCROLL WAVES

Consider these famous photographs of the chemical waves studied by Ilya Prigogine and others. Although the patterns formed in the dish of chemicals are startling, and although the last stages are entirely unlike the first stages, still, once again, if we examine each stage, we see a simple and natural evolution from pattern to pattern, without apparent discontinuity.

At each step the wholeness –– the overall sense of the pattern in its global configuration — is preserved, and the changes occur within the respectful maintenance of global structure of pattern, form, and the underlying system of centers<!--18-->.

28  
##### EVOLUITION OF MOLLUSKS

Once again, the evolution of organic species: intermediate stages in the evolution of one mollusk subspecies to another. In this instance, the transitions are almost invisible, the path is so smooth<!--19-->.

##### FORMATION OF A PLANE SURFACE ON A GROWING CRYSTAL

A very simple example. Since incoming molecules prefer to go to the stickiest part of a growing crystal — i.e., to the places where there is the greatest binding energy from molecules already in place — this has the effect that the plane face will attract molecules in such a way as to continue the plane face. Irregular arrangements in which new molecules would sprout randomly, on the plane surface, are extremely unlikely to occur. The effect is that the plane surface perpetuates itself, and the wholeness is preserved. The crystal grows in a way that most of the time preserves the wholeness<!--20-->.

>Stages in the evolution from one species of mollusk to another. See the comment under “Evolution Of Different Beaks In Subspecies Of Hawaiian Finches.

>Growth of a plane face of a salt crystal. Of the three possible types of location, the one which has the most binding energy, and hence the most “stickiness” for an incoming molecule (marked “a” above), is the one which, when repeated, creates a plane face.

##### GROWTH OF CRYSTAL AS A WHOLE: STAGES OF CAPPING PROCESS IN GROWTH OF ACRYSTAL OF AMMONIUM DIHYDRO GEN PHOSPHATE

In the more elaborate case of a crystal such as this pyramidal crystal form, even when a nonpyramidal slice of the material is placed in a solution, the ragged edges grow so fast that they quickly move upward and downward at the proper angle for the crystal (caused by the chemical bonds). In this wholeness, W, the edges appear as the strongest centers and cause the most rapid growth; they then develop spontaneously in a way that continues and extends the structure<!--21-->.

##### DEVELOPMENT OF ALGAE: SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF A COLONY OF GOLDEN ALGAE

If we read from A to H, we see the gradual creation of stalks, until finally we have an entire sprouted structure. What happens at any given stage is always a natural evolution from the previous structure. For instance, when we go from D to E, it looks as if something entirely new has happened. But the wholeness of stage D already has a unique condition at the top end of the stalk. Thus, from the point of view of the wholeness, there is already a latent center there at the top of the stalk. The fact that at stage E this is embodied by a system of sprouting buds is entirely consistent with the latent wholeness that was there before. The same is true in the transition between F and G<!--22-->.

##### STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON MUSHROOM AND AND BACTERIAL GROWTH: DEVELOPMENT IN THE MYCOBACTERIUM CHONDROMYCES CROCATUS

Both these examples — the mushroom on this page and the bacterium on the next — show an organism budding, sprouting, and becoming many-limbed, always under a slow growth process while preserving structure<!--23-->.

##### COLLAPSE OF A SMOOTH CYLINDER UNDER BUCKING INTO SYMMETRIC PATTERNS OF DYMPLES

A thin cylinder, buckled by uniform pressure from above, shows a remarkable symmetric pattern of dimples. This phenomenon is intuitively unexpected. Present thinking suggests that, as buckling occurs, the infinite group of rotations characteristic of the smooth cylinder is reduced and replaced by a finite group of rotations, which is one of its subgroups. So, as it buckles, though it has to give up some structure, most of its structure (defined in this instance by the finite symmetry group) is preserved. See also the discussion in chapter 2, page 63<!--24-->.

##### FORMATION OF A PLANETALRY MOON

This picture shows the theory of moon formation that the French mathematician JulesHenri Poincaré formulated in the late I9th century. Even though it is now fairly certain that Poincaré's pear-shaped blob theory does not give an accurate picture of the sequence that actually takes place, I still show it because the picture sequence shows the typical character of an unfolding sequence in beautiful and intuitive terms.  

>The Growth of a bacterium

>Buckling of a hollow cylinder when compressed

>Poincaré's (incorrect) theory for the evolution of a planetary moon. I show it in spite of its inaccuracy because it was one of the earliest attempts to see the unfolding process in action.


***
31  
In the absence of a more accurate modern picture once again, in this theory, we see a smooth sequence of unfolding, in which each stage seems to presage the following stage. The evolution, though highly dramatic in its overall results, shows an almost imperceptible structure-reserving character, as it moves from stage to stage<!--25-->.

##### GENERATION OF SLIME MOLD: FOUR STAGES OF AGGREGATION OF DICTYOSTELIUM

It is remarkable that even in the case of cell aggregation, as in the slime mold pictured here, the coalescence of the thousands of particles and their gradual formation into a coherent blob once again shows smoothness at every stage. Even here, we can see the wholeness preserved, as the form unfolds.

What happens mechanically, in this case, is that the chemical agent acrasin is diffused. The concentration gradient of the acrasin, sent out by the individual swimming cells, becomes a basis for orientation, and as a result the thousands of cells then slowly swim toward each other. Remarkably, the cells give the impression of swimming toward a center, even though this center is only manifested, mechanically, as a chemical gradient in the water. In fact, the concentration of acrasin is simply highest at the center of gravity of the individual swimming cells. This center of concentration, once formed, then becomes a real entity in the ensuing configuration because of the chemotaxis it induces. The swimming cells are mechanically influenced by this center of concentration, and the increasing aggregation of cells then intensifies the concentration further, yet further increasing the physical creation of the entity we see as a center in the mold<!--26-->.


#####  A GLASS PLATE SHATTERING

Even here, in a violent event, the process is completely smooth.  

>Generation of a slime mold body from individual cells by coordinated aggregation

>Step 1: Bullet enters.  
Step 2: Effect starts on far side of glass.  
Step 3: Effect spreads out though glass in bowl-like zone.  
Step 4: Effect widens: the shear cone in the glass is severed.  
Four stages, only microseconds apart, showing how the explosive shattering of the glass when the bullet hits it, is a well-formed developmental process, in which each configuration leads, and gives way, smoothly to the next.

***
32  
Shattering glass seems sudden because, to us, it happens very quickly –– in microseconds –– and in our own time scale it appears disturbing, alarming, sudden.

But when we examine the actual sequence of events over time, and consider the stages of the evolution, one microsecond at a time, as seen below, we see a process in which yet again each new stage develops from the previous stage quite smoothly. The big, winged form, which develops as the smash propagates, itself originates with a tiny crack, visible in the second picture. If we look at the structure that exists in the second picture –– the bullet, and the plane which it induces tangent to its tip and parallel to the glass plane –– create a configuration in which one can almost sense, or see in advance, the big, winged curve which is about to form. The coming curve is first latent in the structure, and then develops smoothly from the structure as the inevitable next geometric phase of unfolding.

The shattering of the glass itself depends on latent dislocations present in the material before the impact, which are enlarged after impact. Even this most violent and most catastrophic event arises smoothly from the wholeness that was there<!--27-->.

## 5/ APPEARANCE OF THE FIFTEEN PROPERTIES

In all these natural examples, one thing stands out. The process of formation that occurs in nature –– whether it happens in microseconds or over millions of years, whether it is large or small, whether it comes from the organic or the inorganic world — is in every case _smoothly structure-preserving_. Each of the sequences in the last pages shows a sequence where successive stages are so alike as to be hardly distinguishable. Yet what is accomplished overall, from the beginning to the end of each sequence, is enormous. New form comes into being. Morphogenesis occurs. New form that is, in almost every case, unpredictable from the initial state appears smoothly via a sequence of tiny continuous changes.

The sequences are not merely smooth. We have, in every case, a sequence in which new structure grows organically, holistically, from the structure which is there already. One whole gives rise to another.

It is this smooth and elegant “becoming” or unfolding of the whole which is the characteristic of nature. The continuity and smoothness of unfolding wholeness may seem obvious. Indeed, in a certain sense, it _is_ obvious. Yet, as a creative process, it is sharply at odds with the human process of creation we have come to expect in contemporary art and architecture.

And throughout these examples, the fifteen properties appear again and again.  We see LEVELS OF SCALE appear in mushrooms, in planetary systems, in vortices, in shattered glass. We see STRONG CENTERS almost everywhere, in the formation of galaxies, in the Darwinian evolution of a bird's beak, in the growth of a colony of algae. We have seen BOUNDARIES in the sun's corona, in the boundary of the living cell, in the banks of the Rio Negro River as it pours out into the Amazon. We see ALTERNATING REPETITION in vortices and in the buckling cylinder and in the evolution of the feathered and winged Archaeopteryx from dinosaurs (page 41). We see POSITIVE SPACE in the formation of the frog embryo and in the wing positions of the flying pigeon and in the breaking wave. We see GOOD SHAPE appearing in the form of leaves and mushrooms, in the Chladni figures on a vibrating plate (shown in Book 1), in the spirals of the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction, in the bends of a meandering river (page 36). We see LOCAL SYMMETRIES in crystal growth, in flowers, in the formation of slime mold. We see GRADIENTS emerging in stream flow of a river, in the distribution of twigs and branches on a tree (page 39).  
***
33  
We see ECHOES and their associated angles showing up in crystals, metals, geological formations, and sand ripples (page 35). ROUGHNES appears throughout, as a consequence of the fine adaptation present in all unfolding, since each shape can be minutely adjusted, without needing rigid geometry. CONTRAST appears as the result of differentiation in the formation of a galaxy, as in the dimples of a buckled cylinder. DEEP INTERLOCK AND AMBIGUITY appears in the unfolding of a mushroom, and in the vortices of turbulent flow. We see SIMPLICITY AND INNER CALM in the surface of a lake as in the line of dewdrops on a spider web (page 64) and in the buckling cylinder. We see THE VOID make its appearance in the gaps between the clouds and in the eye of a hurricane. We see NOT-SEPARATENESS in river-bedecology, in the vegetation of a forest, and in the imbrication of the human lung. In all these processes, living structure emerges slowly, steadily.

_Why_ this happens still needs to be explained.

## 6/ THE FIFTEEN PROPERTIES EMERGE DIRECTRY FROM THE UNFOLDING OF THE WHOLE

Let us consider two examples, both from embryology, in rather more detail. I want to show that the unfolding of these embryos (which I characterize as wholeness-preserving) follows a particular path, and that during the path the form evolves in a way that gradually increases the extent to which the fifteen properties are present, and developed.

 If you look at the mouse foot first, you see that it starts, essentially, as a blob. This is literally true, of course. It is an undifferentiated cell mass with relatively few features of its morphology, yet visible. In a period of about four days, the forelimb and foot are formed, and as we see it forming, we see that it develops as a whole, and as an articulated whole, which displays the fifteen properties, more and more strongly. CENTERS become visible, both in the limbs, the fingers, and the joints. We see ALTERNATING REPETITION in the space between the fingers; we see Bound ARIEs at the ends of the different bone segments (what will later turn into muscle and ligament); GOOD SHAPE is visible in the shape of the hand as a whole, and the shapes of individual bone segments become swollen and beautiful. LOCAL SYMMETRIES are plainly present in the formation of the whole, in the paired forelimb bones;  

>Development of mouse foot

***
34  
ECHOES is strongly visible in the similarities of all the different bones, and the fact that the angle-character of all the bones are strongly alike; GRADIENTS are visible in the gradient from small finger to large, and in the distribution of finger joints from base to tip; LEVELS OF SCALE are beautifully present, and within two days, develop in the size of bones, the hierarchy of sizes, and the hierarchy of visible components; even THE VOID, oddly, makes its appearance in the gap between the two forelimb bones.

How should we view all this activity, and how should we interpret it? Biologists have, of course, accumulated a great deal of information about the way that chemical gradients, in the cells, create patterns by position<!--28-->. But what remains missing from their analysis is the way in which this thing moves forward _as a whole_, retains its coherence _as a whole_ from start to finish, and how the coordination of the different parts, and the beauty of the whole thing, is maintained.

The same occurs in the formation of the seed of a flowering plant (Shepherd's Purse or _Capsella bursa-pastoris_). The sequence shown gives the development of one seed, after the flower itself matures. We see the appearance of strongly differentiated lumps (top and bottom), forming defined and distinct CENTERS; we see formation of DEEP INTERLOCK, in the indentation, of LOCAL SYMMETRIES in the appearance of the two cotyledons; the final beautiful and compact GOOD SHAPE of the whole is obvious. ROUGHNESS pervades, and is of the essence in the cell packing, to permit good shape to be formed; POSITIVE SPACE appears in the cell shapes, in the invagination, and in the whole. Once again, literal minded examination of what the individual cells do, as they split and migrate, does not account for the beauty of the unfolding process, nor for the beauty of the result<!--29-->.


_Yet the beauty and coherence of the result is the most remarkable feature of the process._

The fifteen properties do emerge from an unfolding, which protects and enhances the whole, and in the differentiations which occur, as the whole develops, it is always the fifteen properties, one or another of them, which guide the differentiations. In effect, it is as if the kinds of differentiation which can occur, are enumerated, and restricted to the possibilities laid down by the fifteen properties.  

>Development of an angiosperm seed: Shepherd's Purse

35
It is these fifteen properties which do all the work, of making the whole, and of making the whole beautiful. The chemistry and cell migrations are the mechanisms which do the work, but they are simply not the principal thing which is going on.

## 7/ PREVIOUSLY OFFERD EXPLANATIONS OF EMERGENCE FROM THE WHOLE

Throughout centuries of study of nature, many, many cases of emergence of form from the whole have been observed and studied. Many have been matter-of-fact. Rarely, until now, has it been seen as necessary to propose new mechanisms of emergence. Generally speaking, the emergence of form in the world has been seen and understood as a relatively straightforward mechanical emergence of the product of different causal laws.

The possibility that a new principle, altogether, might need to be invoked, and above all, that the unfolding of the whole might have to be seen, in its own right, as a fundamental principle of nature –– these are relatively new ideas. And certainly we shall not wish to propose or invoke an entirely new principle, if this is not absolutely needed — if it is not _required_ — by the failure of existing explanations.

Let us therefore examine some existing explanations, as we have them today:


##### MECHANICAL ORIGINS OF LIVING CENTERS

The simplest kind of explanation is just mechanical and “accidental.” For example, here is a classic mechanical explanation for one particular system of centers: the appearance of ALTERNATING REPETITION in the wave-like ripples of wind-blown desert sand. Suppose we have a desert or a dry beach surface with millions of grains of sand about equal in size and weight. Any grain that is slightly irregular sticks up; as the wind blows over the sand, it will pick up any grain that sticks up, and will carry it a certain distance, where it drops it, once again “sticking up." Since the grains are similar in size and weight, the wind tends to carry them all the same distance.

>Alternating repetition formed as ridges in wind-blown sand

***
36  
Wherever an irregularity occurs, it tends to be repeated by this “wavelength” downwind. Gradually any ridge-like pattern is duplicated, one wavelength downwind, by a second ridge. This second ridge will then be duplicated by a further ridge, another full “wavelength” downwind. After the wind has been blowing for some time, the sand has an overall pattern of wave-like ridges which lie at right angles to the direction of the wind. They are not waves at all; the apparent wavelength is simply the distance that the wind carries an average grain of sand<!--30-->. This purely mechanical explanation shows how, in this particular case, ALTERNATING REPETITION — repeating ridges alternating with valleys — is produced. The explanation for its appearance is entirely mechanical. The local mechanics of the situation create a pattern in the whole.

##### In similar fashion, we have looked at the case of the growing salt crystal, where LOCAL SYMMETRIES are created in the faces of the crystal.  

As we have already seen, crystals grow as they do because new atoms attach themselves to the array of atoms in the corners with most binding energy.  As a result, plane faces emerge, even though there is no guiding hand making the faces of the crystal plane. The larger whole, and the local symmetries which form the plane surface, arise from the action of the local mechanics<!--31-->. STRONG CENTERS and GOOD SHAPE appear in loops of a meandering river, because of the mechanical action of stream flow. When a minor irregularity occurs — the start of a bend — centrifugal force throws the water in the top layer outward, thus eroding the outer bank of the curve still further and then, balanced by downstream deposition of silt, gradually creating a full concave curve which we see as a loop or a meander in the river<!--32-->.

In these mechanical cases, the whole — the marvelous pattern of the whole –– emerges from the interaction of small events and local circumstances. The whole itself appears almost as if by accident. Certainly, in these cases, there does not appear to be a need for any explanation in which the whole itself takes a hand and guides events.

The classical picture of nature was of a system formed and guided entirely by such local mechanical laws.

But these local explanations are far too specific to answer our questions. Although each can explain a particular phenomenon, they are not generalizable, and they give no general insight into the general question: why do ALTERNATING REPETITION, or LOCAL SYMMETRIES, or GOOD SHAPE appear repeatedly _in general_? The process which forms alternating repetition in a cirrus cloud is not the same as the process which causes grains of sand to form ridges in the sand.

>The adherence of the individual molecules continues and enhances the plane face of the crystal.

>Strong centers and good shape formed by mechanical process: meandering loops are formed by centrifugal processes in the evolution of a river

***
37  
The process which forms good shape in a Gingko leaf (page 7o) is not similar to the process which forms the beautiful full-bellied loops in a meandering river. Nor do these mechanical explanations give much insight into the still more basic question: why, most generally of all, is there an overall tendency in nature for living structure to appear?

##### THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST ACTION

The fact that individual mechanical explanations are too limited, and that the wealth of morphogenesis which occurs in the world needs a unifying explanation within which all morphogenesis maybe seen as having a common origin, has been the subject of much speculation. Since the efforts of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century, there have been many attempts to formulate a more general basis for understanding morphogenesis. Nearly all have sought, in one fashion or another, to explain how the wholeness of the world in the large is responsible for the emergence of form in its holistic aspects. Among the most significant is the principle of least action, first formulated by the French mathematician Maupertuis about 1744, restated in the 19th century as Hamilton's principle, and still in use today as a vital component of quantum field theory<!--33-->. The principle says that the evolution of any dynamic system will always follow the path of least work.

Let us see what THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST ACTION is trying to do.

Consider a soap bubble. A single bubble floating in air is roughly spherical. What is the process that makes it spherical? We can understand the local surface tension as a system of forces. But it is hard to understand the effect of all these forces on the bubble as a whole, by studying these individual local forces acting locally. It becomes easier when we recognize that, for a given volume of air, the bubble takes that shape which minimizes the surface area. The resulting form happens to be an example of GOOD SHAPE. But why does it happen? When the surface area is minimized, the potential energy is minimized. Might we say that morphogenesis occurs because of a general tendency for systems to move towards a state with minimum potential energy? Many systems do evolve in the direction which minimizes their potential energy. The deeper problem is that we are then faced with the question, Why should the potential energy be minimized?


Or consider two wires of equal resistance that are wired in parallel to a battery. The electric current then distributes itself equally. This is so familiar that it seems obvious. It also happens to be a case of LOCAL SYMMETRY. Yet what physical principle is causing the symmetry? We can explain it by using Ohm's law (1=W/R, implying that the two currents must be equal if the two resistances are equal). But why is it true? To get a deeper explanation of why the currents in the two wires are equal, we can make a further assumption about systems: we can explain the configuration of the larger structure, the whole, by assuming that the flow of electricity distributes itself in such a way as to minimize the rate of heat production. If translated into electrical terms, this more general principle becomes equivalent to Ohm's law, and gets the right answer; it predicts that the currents will be equal.  

>A spherical soap bubble, or complex system of bubbles, takes that shape which has the configuration of least potential energy.

***
38  
But why should _this_ formulation get the right answer? Why _should_ the rate of heat production be minimized _in general systems_? What is it about nature that makes it act to minimize the rate of heat production?

The same question arises in many forms. If I tell you that soap film in a bubble arranges itself in such a way that the potential energy of the bubble's surface is minimized, this explanation helps because it is a profound principle which helps us predict the bubbles in complex configurations. Since it predicts correctly, we know that it is true. But that does not help us understand the _existence_ of the principle. _Why_ should the potential energy be minimized?

A river meanders with a certain characteristic kind of bend, a wide curve, and the curves are spaced at about ten times the width of the river. These meanders occur in such a way as to minimize the energy consumption at the bends. So in this case, the principle of minimum-energy consumption is responsible for STRONG CENTERS in the bends of the meander, for GRADIENTS, GOOD SHAPE, and POSITIVE SPACE<!--34--> The branches of a tree branch, roughly, at that angle which makes the consumption of energy, in the sap-flow, a minimum. In this case, LEVELS OF SCALE are again produced by another version of the minimum-energy principle<!--35-->. But _why_ does a river move in just that way which consumes least energy? _Why_ does a tree branch in such a way as to make the work which the sap does a minimum. Why is that? What kind of principle is this<!--36-->?

We can work out the fact that trees branch in such a fashion so that the flow of sap does the least work. The bee's honeycomb is arranged in such a way that the angle of joining is the most efficient. We can show that a normal leaf is shaped in such a way as to produce the shape in which the weight is supported by the least weight of material<!--37-->. The river winds in such a fashion as to have the least expenditure of flow energy and least heat loss from friction. Light travels through a composite medium in such a way as to minimize the time taken by the ray.

Why, and why, and why? Hardly one of these principles has a complete and satisfying _mechanical_ explanation. It is always the global effect of some larger principle, calling for least energy, or least work, coupled with the detailed mechanics, which finally provides the explanation.

The principle of least action was formulated essentially to summarize these many principles and others like them. The principle says that the “action,” S, the rate of expenditure of energy twice integrated over time, is minimized in any system. This principle generalizes the examples I have given, and many others. It is one of the most general principles of this kind ever discovered and essentially underlies all the others. Max Planck said of it, "Present-day physics is completely governed by a system of differential equations...this entire rich system of differential equations, though they differ in detail since they refer to mechanical, electrical, magnetic and thermal processes, is now completely contained in a single theorem, the principle of least action.<!--38-->" The principle is now viewed by physicists as indispensable to the underpinning of modern quantum field theory<!--39-->.

But like the simpler minimum-energy principles, this principle, too, is not in _itself_ comprehensible enough, nor intuitively general or convincing enough, to explain the complex appearance of the fifteen properties in living structures.

>If the wires have equal resistance, the current balances itself equally between the two parallel wires.

***
39  
There are so many _different_ explanations for these kinds of phenomena. For example, Peter Stevens was able to provide three equally convincing explanations for the meander pattern of an evolving river. All three give correct numerical predictions for the curvature and frequency of loops. Yet they are quite different from one another. One is based on least-energy consumption: essentially least action. One is based on the action of centrifugal force. One is based on the fact that the highest probability path for a fixed-length random walk between two points will take the form of a meander<!--40-->. The three are not numerically equivalent.  

So the uneasy sense exists that there is more here than meets the eye. Various holistic explanations have been formulated. No single one of these holistic explanations is clearly “the" origin of the other explanations. Under the surface, something still more general must be going on. Some still more fundamental unifying explanation is needed, something which truly underlies all phenomena.

##### NON-LINEAR DYNAMICS

There is a new class of explanations which some believe may give us such a general kind of explanation. In the case of current flow, the global behavior of current in distributing itself in an electrical system can be simulated by a model in which individual electrons choose the path which is least constricted. The global behavior then comes about from interactions of individual local behaviors. Since the arrival of high-speed computers, it has become possible to simulate the behavior of many complex systems by making up simple rules which approximate the behavior of component elements, and then simulating the interaction of these rules.

>Elm tree branches with constant branching angle

>Diagram of constant branching angle

***
40  
With the help of this approach, we have been able to create (and thus explain) many large-scale configurations similar to those we see in nature. More generally, in recent years the new science of complexity theory, and the study of non-linear systems modeled by computer, have provided an entirely new class of explanations for the forms we see in nature. Prigogine, Thom, Mandelbrot, Feigenbaum, Kauffman, Goodwin, and hundreds of others have demonstrated that highly complex, ordered phenomena can arise as a result of relatively simple interactions among variables linked by non-linear equations. These non-linear systems, which can usually not be solved by arithmetic techniques, have become accessible to study largely through the use of computers which simulate, in effect, the path of the evolving system over time.

Some of these techniques have produced spectacular results. Realistic-seeming snowflakes, turbulence in liquid systems, formation of clouds, weather prediction, simulations of the formation of mountain ranges, the breaking of waves, and embryonic morphogenesis have all become accessible to study. In all these cases, the technique involves interaction of a few variables, iterated in the computer in such a way as to produce results similar to the natural systems being studied.

The literature has grown profusely. There are by now thousands upon thousands of pages of such simulations, many of them seeming to provide accurate approximations of the phenomena they simulate.

***
41  
Have we, then, finally understood how nature works? And, most important for our discussion here, have we understood the origin of the fifteen properties, and the appearance of living structure throughout nature?

Central to the studies in complexity theory, is the discovery that these systems converge to attractors (small regions in the state-space of the system), and that because of the mathematical behavior of the state-space, order will arise in these systems spontaneously, under suitable conditions. This discovery has recently held out the promise that the evolution of biological organisms, and the problems of development and growth in organisms, may be orderly in large part because of the mathematical properties of the state-space for these systems (according to Kauffman, Goodwin, et al.).

However, even with these very powerful techniques, what has so far been explained is still a little thin from a practical point of view. At least for the present, the specific appearance of the fifteen properties, and the emergence of living centers in the world, are hardly more clear now than before. Although certain specific structures appear and can be explained as a result of these dynamical systems (see, for instance, the results of Brian Goodwin's classic work, shown opposite), just as simpler mechanical schemes can explain simpler cases, the general features of the living systems which I have described in Book I, and above all the features which give them life as I have defined it, so far remain largely unexplained.

So, even with these techniques, the appearance of living structure in the world has so far only just been touched. While these techniques may one day explain a great deal, the one specific thing we need to understand in order to make better buildings – that is, the appearance of the fifteen properties – has barely even been opened as a topic.

##### STILL OTHER KINDS OF STRUCTURE CREATION, ALSO NOT EASILY EXPLAINABLE

There are still other types of structure creation –– also showing the appearance of the fifteen properties –– which seem unlikely to be explained either by the least-action principle or by spontaneous order creation from non-linear systems.

Biological evolution is perhaps the most obvious. The selection mechanism postulated by Darwinian theory always had difficulty explaining features of the evolutionary sequence, when these features can only be arrived at along a path which involves steps that are not themselves advantageous. For example, _Archaeopteryx_ (the first bird) had feathers and used its feathered wings to fly. This is clearly an evolutionary advantage. But how would a partly developed wing, with little tufts –– presumably the precursors of feathers — get any selective advantage? This is harder to understand. Although Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins have made good arguments for step-wise advantages being enough to move the evolving genotype towards complex functional order, these arguments are not yet entirely convincing<!--42-->.

Similar questions can be asked about the famous bombardier beetle (which injects its prey with poison)<!--43-->. What form did the poison injecting mechanism have when it was half-way developed?  

>Artist's reconstruction of Archaeopteryx –a dinosaur-like creature found in Jurassic limestone together with fossilized feathers, and believed to be the first feathered bird

***
42  
How was it advantageous in an incomplete form? Or, if not, how did evolution select toward the half-formed injecting mechanism as it evidently must have done (to get to the fully developed one)? Rational discussion of this issue has been complicated in recent years by the creationist community who believe that organisms were formed by God's design and believe that the bombardier beetle somehow supports their case. In response to the irrational character of the creationist argument, many scientists have been spending their energy trying to insist, “no it is not God's design, Mr. Creationist, it is by a series of step-wise changes, gradually evolving,” instead of answering the difficult question about how the very sophisticated machinery was actually arrived at, step by step<!--44-->. Of course (for me anyway) the question is not “Was it by God's design, or was it step-by-step?” No doubt it was step-by-step. But how does step-by-step _actually_ accomplish its results when the result requires sophisticated and complex global geometry to work.

##### Consider this case more carefully.  

The beetle defends itself by squirting hot poison. The mechanism which does it is pretty darn complicated. When you ask how it evolved, can one honestly say that it came about _merely_ as a result of a series of random mutations causing steps, each of which was advantageous, by itself, at the time it happened? Along the way you have various half-formed squirt guns. Does a half-formed squirt gun work at all, or is there a pattern-like tendency which makes transformations toward coherent patterns (based on the fifteen properties) which then tend to produce coherent mechanisms for geometric reasons –– _and the selective pressure then finds a use for these beautiful and coherent mechanisms to gain advantages_.

Is it not possible that the emergence of large-scale pattern –– global order –– comes about merely from many small Darwinian step-by-step changes, but modified and improved by some kind of directional twist in the dynamics of the evolving system which makes it go towards global patterns of a certain sort, and that it is this pattern-seeking or pattern-creating tendency which must be taken into account, _together_ with selective advantage of small steps, if one really wants a satisfactory explanation of the evolutionary sequences in detail?

_According to this view, the evolving system of the genetic material ITSELF causes evolution to follow certain pathways, not only because of selective pressure from outside, but also by virtue of its own internal dynamical ordering tendencies. The results of evolution are then to be understood mainly formed not by Darwinian selective pressure acting from outside, but by pressures created by the geometry and dynamics of the evolving genetic system itself_. One powerful outline of such a theory has been published by Stuart Kauffman, who believes it may be caused by system effects of the coupling between an evolving genotype and its fitness landscape<!--45-->. Another version of such a view was put forward about 1960, by Lancelot Whyte, who thought it might be an internal interaction among molecules of the evolving chromosome<!--46-->.

If true — and such theories seem to hold promise for explaining many problems that have been glossed over by neo-Darwinian evolutionists –– it means that there is essentially something in the _geometry_ of living systems which contributes order by itself: that the biological material evolves, and advances, on the basis of some tendency to order embedded in the very action of the process, and interacting with the Darwinian selection.

Although there is some growing acceptance of this view, the specific proposals made by Kauffman do not yet explain in detail how this purely geometrical evolution works, nor do they give sufficient detail to allow us to explain anything particular. Explanations have yet to be given. So the tendency for evolution to create geometrically ordered biological structures remains (so far) largely unexplained by detailed theory.

Other examples of morphogenesis also pose puzzling questions. For instance: a growing bone adds material at that point where the stress is greatest –– so that the resulting shape of the bone, which emerges from the growth, tends to equalize the stress in every part of the bone<!--47-->.
***
43  
This requires a mechanical process in which the growth tissue simply gets added on at the point where stress or strain energy is greatest. The idea is simple. Even the mechanism may be clear once molecular biologists have isolated the particular mechanism responsible for translating strain energy to growth. But _how_ is it happening? The idea of selective advantage acting over generations seems absurdly remote from the simplicity and directness of the growth process itself.

And puzzles of order formation remain even in simple domains of elementary chemistry and physics. For example, the shapes of snow crystals, with their endless variety of hexagonal symmetry, are even today not yet fully explained (page 44). Each snow crystal grows as it falls through freezing moist air, and each crystal is unique in its configuration. But the puzzling thing is: why are the six arms of one crystal so nearly alike? Each crystal has overall hexagonal symmetry. The general symmetry and the 60-degree angle it is based on are explained by the angle of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a water molecule, and by the accretive process which builds the crystal from these molecules. But why is the detailed structure on any one of the six arms of a given crystal so _exactly_ like the structure on the other five arms?  

>The end of a bone

>Lines of tension and compression in the bone are perfectly orthogonal: thus making the bone almost perfectly efficient. This is accomplished because the bone always adds material where the strain is greatest.

>Different naturally occurring snowflakes. Note the second-order symmetries which make each arm similar to the other arms in great detail, with no obvious mechanical explanation of how this happens.


***
44  
Starting from the center of the snowflake, molecules are added, one at a time, to form the crystal. How is it that what is happening at the end of one arm is duplicated almost exactly by what is happening at the end of five other arms, hundreds of atoms away, even though the pattern is different for each different crystal? Diffusion-aggregation explanations have managed to simulate a rough overall symmetry of this kind when the crystal growth is compressed, so that the spatial constraints help to form something with these local symmetries<!--48-->. The crystal shapes generated by these diffusion-aggregation models are something like naturally occurring snow crystals (see illustration above). But the phenomenon occurs, also, in an open crystal where atoms are further apart, like these illustrated. The nearly identical detail on the six arms is not explained by any present diffusion-aggregation model that I know of And saying that the same formations arise because of the same conditions of temperature and pressure does not explain the really remarkable symmetries, sub-symmetries, and sub-sub-symmetries which occur in the patterns forming on the six arms and sub-arms of these crystals.

A still more powerful example of unexplained form creation has been put forward by Roger Penrose. His famous quasi-symmetric tiling pattern of stars and pentagons has been found in naturally occurring crystalline alloys discovered by Dan Schechtman and his colleagues; and has now been extended to a wider class of crystals known as quasicrystals<!--49-->.  Penrose has stated that the order seen in these quasicrystals requires a non-local ingredient in their assembly. In his words: “In assembling the pattern, it is necessary from time to time, to examine the state of the pattern many atoms away, if one is to be sure of not making a serious error when putting the pieces together.<!--50-->” How, then, does nature know how to do it? The molecular assembly must apparently be guided by a process which acts on the basis of the larger-scale order. Recently published suggestions about the practical mechanism by which these long-range forms of order are created in the case of the metal alloys, do indeed propose non-local action — via such things as electronic resonances which act in the large, and overlapping clusters of atoms which are capable of being coordinated by larger scale geometry<!--51-->.

_In each of these puzzling cases, it appears that some inherently geometric principle of form-creation is at work, encouraging a coherent large-scale order to emerge_. We do not yet know what it is. All we know for sure about it is that in each of these examples new geometric form — with an increase of living structure and large-scale order –– springs, in steps, from an older form.  

>Diffusion-Aggregation simulation of a snowflake made by H. Eugene Stanley. Though broadly accurate as a loose generalized picture of a snowflake, the deep structure of the local symmetries inside the arms that we observe in nature, and the similarities from arm to arm, are not even remotely as pronounced — indeed are barely visible at all, in the simulation.

## 8/ A PRINCIPLE OF UNFOLDING WHOLENESS

I propose an analysis that is, in principle, capable of answering these unanswered questions about how living structure emerges.  

In the cases we have looked at, we see that again and again, in nature, living structure seems to “emerge.” Along with the operation of the local laws, something is going on, rarely explained by local laws alone, which makes living structure, coherent centers, and the fifteen properties appear in the large. Why does this happen?  

I suggested in Book I that these fifteen properties are the glue from which wholeness is constructed. Asking how they come about in the world is, in another form, therefore the same as asking why wholeness itself comes about in the world. And this is no less than asking how living structure comes about. The wholeness, when it is more intense, is created from the wholeness or life of individual centers. Why do centers arise at all? Why do centers become more intense or more alive? What is it that makes wholeness altogether become more intense, more alive with time?

Mixed in with this question, there is an important minor puzzle. Living structure, and the fifteen properties, clearly do not appear in the world all the time. Even though nature manifests these properties frequently, we know that whatever law of nature is making them appear is a law that doesn't always apply. Why do I say that? Because in some cases of human artifacts we have seen very clearly that they do not have the fifteen properties –– so whatever law it is that creates these properties in nature, must be breaking down at least in some of those human-inspired cases. We know that buildings sometimes do have the properties, and sometimes do not have them. Traditional society often seems to have created them, contemporary society seems to have created them less often. So, if there is a law of nature which is creating these fifteen properties, this law is a temperamental law, which only works _sometimes_.

Be clear what this means. The law of gravity is a law of nature. It is not temperamental. It applies everywhere, all the time. It applies in traditional society, and it applies in modern society. But whatever law is making living structure appear is different. Evidently, it sometimes breaks down and fails to operate. That is what makes it so extremely hard to understand how it can be acting _in nature_. When I say I want to understand some general law which is responsible for making the fifteen properties appear in nature, whatever this law is, it must also explain why it is temperamental, why it breaks down sometimes at some scales, and why it breaks down specifically at the macroscopic scale in the building production of modern society. Even the principle of least action, highly general and holistic in nature though it is, does not explain why the fifteen properties keep on occurring in the world.

What then is the explanation for the appearance of centers and of the fifteen properties in nature? I believe the wholeness which I have introduced in Book I sheds a great deal of light on the puzzle, and can give us a consistent way of explaining what is going on.

Look again at the variety of cases I have given as examples. Behind the scenes in _all_ of them, there is what _appears to be_ a consistent thrust toward order. In the terms which I have explained earlier in this book, there is, in all of them, a process in which the fifteen properties are appearing more and more strongly. Through this process, then, centers are getting created and strengthened.

Is it possible to think about all these cases in a way which is fundamentally the same? I believe it is. Underlying all these cases there is a geometrical principle, reminiscent of the principle of least action, but more general. This principle may be formulated as follows: _the evolution of any natural system is governed by transformations of the mathematical wholeness and by a tendency, inherent in these transformations, for the whole to unfold in a particular direction_.
***
46  
In more detail, I postulate that every natural system has a disposition, a tendency caused by the most simple way forward for the system to move in the direction which preserves wholeness. I do not mean that it preserves wholeness in some pious emotional sense, nor that it “wishes” to preserve wholeness. _I simply mean that wholeness, which I have defined as a structure of symmetries and centers (Book I, chapter 3 and appendix I), will always have a natural dynamic of such a nature that as many as possible of these symmetries (and especially some of the larger ones) are preserved as the system moves forward in time_. _As the system evolves, it destroys these symmetries and larger centers_ AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. It _maintains_ as much of the structure of symmetries and centers as possible, and _destroys as little_ of the structure of symmetries and centers as can be managed while yet moving forward.

This idea is consistent with ideas of symmetry-breaking that have recently made their appearance in modern physics, but it is more comprehensive and, as an idea, more extended. As noted, it is, in character, somewhat like the principle of least action, except that it is purely geometrical in character, not arithmetical and not energy-based. It explains the mechanical cases because its effect on systems is almost the same as the law of least action. It is capable of explaining the cases covered by non-linear dynamics, because it introduces something like a geometric attractor into the dynamical systems. And it also explains the enigmatic point about the negative effect of human intervention and the unfortunate human ability to create _non_-living structure. While nature may well have a dynamical tendency to preserve wholeness, it is possible for human beings to violate this tendency, simply by acting in a way which is disrespectful of the wholeness (either on purpose to gain something, or by mistake simply because they fail to see the wholeness accurately) Further, the nature of the wholeness, coupled with this principle, explains how new structure –– the creative and most interesting aspect of nature's morphogenesis — comes about. As we saw in Book I, the centers which occur in a given wholeness, especially the larger ones, appear at first in a diaphanous, weak, and latent form. If the dynamical system acts to preserve and extend these centers, which appear first as weak, nearly invisible structures in a cloudy chaos, the intensifying process will then effectively create entirely new structures, merely by strengthening these centers. As they become strong, as latent centers get strengthened, entirely new and hitherto unseen structures emerge<!--52-->. And, in cases of death and decay, order appears there by means of a similar process that sweeps structure away, while yet preserving many essential symmetries.

Thus the principle of unfolding wholeness has great promise as a way of explaining form creation. It introduces little that is new, is consistent with existing physical theory on almost all points, and yet creates an entirely fresh perspective which can explain the emergence of living structure, without our having to resort to a teleological “urge for life.”

 That is what I propose. I do not know whether the principle of unfolding wholeness is, like the principle of least action, simply a concise way of gathering together and understanding a host of individual physical results caused by known laws and processes –– or whether it is a _new_ autonomous principle, more fundamental than the others, and acting with them, causally, to produce results. It is probably wisest for the time being to keep an open mind on this question, and assume that it is indeed merely a way of describing known results. But there remains the possibility that if new predictions about physical processes were to follow from this principle, that one may indeed then consider it as a deeper and more significant way of looking at nature. In either case, this principle describes an important aspect of the behavior of all complex systems.

## 9/ EMERGENCEE OF LIVING STRUCTURE

//Because a system is conservative—because it tends to preserve and extend the existing symmetries and centers — it also tends to reinforce the _larger_ centers which exist, and to make them stronger. This we shall see in more detail in chapters 7–16. We may thus give a stronger formulation of the principle as follows: _at each moment in the emergence of a system, the system tends (prefers”) to go in that direction which intensifies the already existing centers in the wholeness in just such a fashion that the new centers reinforce and intensify the LARGER configuration or wholeness which existed before_.

I suggest that all nature appears as the product of the unfolding wholeness. This means that the living structure we see all around us – in the organic world and in the inorganic world — is not merely a result of interaction of densely coupled systems, but that the wholeness which occurs in space _necessarily_ unfolds in such a way as to create more and more life because through the impact of these transformations, larger wholes are created, intensified _more often than they are destroyed or weakened_. As a result the centers necessarily become more and more profound; and that nature is, in this sense, reaching forward to some kind of order; even though this order is invisible, unpredictable, and not “created.”

What this means is that life and living structure will appear in the world inevitably: not by some magic probabilistic occurrence, but because the nature of things – and, in particular, the mathematical way in which space gives rise to structure which reinforces wholeness – sees to it that living structure comes into being as part of its most normal evolution. This argument implies that all the processes we know –– including the relatively simple mechanical processes, the physical processes governed by the law of least action, the coordinated behavior of complex systems which has been identified from recent work in chaos theory and catastrophe theory, and the evolution of organisms — are _all_ governed by this simple, yet deep regularity, which binds these widely different cases together as a common underlying thread.

I should clarify the extent to which this _new_ principle of unfolding wholeness might genuinely be a new principle separate from other known principles, and to what extent it is merely an unusual way of stating what other well-known principles and laws governing the evolution of physical systems already say. Once again, I take the history of the least-action principle as a way of explaining the situation. The principle of least action is a separately formulated mathematical principle that appears to cover the evolution of most physical systems. It is not separate from other known laws; but nor is it already covered by what they contain. For example, the equal distribution of current in two parallel wires may be deduced from Ohm's law, as referred to above; it may also be deduced from the principle of least action: thus in this one instance the principle adds nothing to Ohm's law, and is equivalent to it, in what it predicts. Yet in other cases, such as the form of a hanging chain, the catenary form may be deduced only from some version of the law of least action, or from the law of least potential energy. Here the principle of least action does more work for us. The different explanations overlap, are sometimes equivalent, and sometimes the law of least action gives new insight into the behavior of a system which is not known or deducible from other laws of physics.

I believe the principle of unfolding wholeness could turn out similarly. In some cases what this principle enunciates is something already covered by known laws, as in the case of the crude appearance of crystal forms, or as in the cases of known development of morphology under laws of pattern formation that have been worked out in biology. However, the principle is not _merely_ another way of expressing results we have already. In other circumstances, the principle of unfolding wholeness adds something which complements and deepens –– may occasionally even replace –– our understanding of known laws. That may be because it is deeper, or a more telling formulation, or because it covers cases that are not easily understood without it. Or it goes deeper, and may be said to be something lying deeper below the surface, under all laws of physics, at the same time that it is consistent with the expression and operation of known physical and biological laws.

There may be special insights to be gained for the case of biological systems. I believe it may even turn out that the apparent mysteries of embryological morphogenesis, and even the anomalous and unexplainable appearance of new organic forms that appear in evolution apparently without selective advantage, will be more easily understandable when we consider that the evolution of any system from time t to time to 1, is governed by a process which works on the centers visible in the system at time t, strengthens some of these centers in a way which preserves and enhances as much of the structure as possible, and destroys as little as possible. That causes the emergence of new, more definite, forms –– and it is the trajectory or pathway of this step-wise evolution, that defines the trajectory of each natural living system.

## 9/ EMERGENCEE OF LIVING STRUCTURE

Whatever else may be said about physics and biology, and the smoothness of the unfolding wholeness we observe in nature, one enormous observation follows for architects.

The history of architecture, especially in the period from 16oo to the present, and culminating in the thought of the 20th century, has been based on the idea that the architect's vision arises, almost spontaneously, and at all events suddenly, in the breast of the architect — a vision obtained from inspiration, that arrives full-fledged, from “thin air” — and that the quality, depth, and importance of the architect's vision comes from this mysterious moment.Contemporary students tremble as they try to attain this mystery<!--54-->.

Yet if the observations of this chapter are held to be true about the production of living structure, and if, as I have suggested, living structure always arises slowly, by successive transformations of what exists, gradually, gradually, and then decisively changes slowly until a new thing is born, then the view of the unfettered architect-creator that has been fostered in the last four hundred years, must be completely wrong.

It is not the way that profound living structure can be created in buildings, it never was, and it never could be. Our idea of what it means to design a building, and to create a profound building form, must be changed for ever by this knowledge.

4. It is very important for me to remind the reader that my use of the phrase “living structure” does not refer merely to what is conventionally known as living structure in biological materials, but also to that living structure, defined in Book I, that is found much more widely throughout what we call “inorganic” nature and also, on occasion, in human artifacts and works of art.  
5. Detailed definitions are given in Book I, appendix I.  
6. See, for example, Murray Gell-Mann, THE JAGUAR AND THE QUARK; and David Abraham, THE SPELL of THE SENSUONS (New York: Pantheon, 1995).  
7. As I said in Book I, each wholeness is, in effect, a nested system of Local SYMMETRIES. In any part of space we have a nested system of centers, each one having certain symmetries, and this system of all the local symmetries is the wholeness.  
8. In using the word “smooth,” I am referring not to the smoothness of mathematical functions (which are smooth when continuously differentiable) but, in a more intuitive sense, to the smoothness of the transitions in the global structure. This smoothness is defined precisely in chapter 2.

15. This situation is very much more complex than the unfolding of the wholeness itself, and I do not know how to describe it accurately. Nevertheless I feel it is vital to include this kind of case, since I am convinced that the principle of unfolding wholeness applies, by extrapolation, to this more complex situation, and that it, too, should ultimately be understood in this way. The same applies to the evolution of the bird's wing, discussed later in this chapter.

Excellent general discussion of such minimum principles appears in Stefan Hildebrandt and Anthony Tromba, MATHEMATICS AND OPTIMAL FORM (New York: 1984) and in Richard Feynman, Robert Leighton, and Matthew Sands, THE FEYNMAN LECTURES ON PHYSICS, vol 2, (Reading, Massachusetts. AddisonWesley, 1964), pp. 19-1 to 19-14. In some cases the whole can be understood as a result of purely local considerations. For example, there is a sophisticated approach to minimum-path questions for quantum phenomena such as the shortest path of a light ray, in which one expresses the global behavior purely as a result of local behaviors. This approach is typified by the sum-over-paths method for photons, where large-scale behavior in a light ray appears as a statistical result of the motion of photons taking all possible paths, with appropriately assigned probabilities.
