## 1/ A DYNAMIC VIEW OF ORDER

In Book 1, I tried to rearrange our definition of architectural order in such a way that it forms a basis for a new view of living structure in buildings and landscapes, escaping from the mechanistic dilemma<!-- 1 -->.

Book 1 invited us to see the world around us-buildings, plants, a painting, our own faces and hands – as field-like structures with centers arranged in a systematic fashion and interacting within the whole. When a structure is living we will feel the echo of our own aliveness in response to it<!-- 2 -->. Book 2 takes the necessary next step of investigating the process of how living structure creates itself over time. A child becomes an adult without ever losing uniqueness or completeness. An acorn transforms smoothly into an oak, although the start and endpoint are radically different. A good building or city will unfold according to the living processes that generate living structure. What I describe throughout Book 2 is a comparably new view of architectural process, with a focus on architectural processes that are capable of generating living structure. It is my hope that a world of architecture, more suitable for human life, will emerge from this new view of living process and of what process is.

Book 2 invites us to reconsider the role and importance of process and how it is living or not. It is about the fact that order cannot be understood sufficiently well in purely static terms because there is something _essentially_ dynamic about order. Living structure can be attained in practice, and will become fully comprehensible and reachable, only from a dynamic understanding. Indeed _the nature of order is interwoven in its fundamental character with the nature of the processes which create the order._

When we look at order dynamically, the concept of living structure _itself_ undergoes some change. Book 1 focused on the idea of living structure, and the viewpoint was geometric, static. In Book 2, I start with a second concept, based on the idea of an _unfolded_ structure. The point of view — even for the structure itself — is dynamic.  

The two conceptions of structure turn out to be complementary. In the end we shall see that living structure and unfolded structure are equivalent. All living structure is _unfolded_ and all unfolded structure is living. And I believe the concept of an unfolded structure is as important, and should play as essential a role in architecture, as the concept of living structure. Thus we shall end up with two equivalent views – one static, one dynamic – of the same idea.

## 2/ THE NECESSARY ROLE OF PROCESS

The task of architecture may be simply stated. We seek to make a living architecture: that means an architecture in which every part, every building, every street, every garden, is alive. It has tens of thousands of living centers in it. It has rooms, gardens, windows, each with their own life. It has stairs, passages, entrances, terraces, columns, column capitals, arches. In a living environment, each of these individual places is a living center in its own right. The window is a glorious living center with light, comfort, view, and so on. The window sill is a living center, with shape, seat, a place for a vase of flowers. Even the smallest part of the most insignificant room, a forgotten corner, has the quality of a living center.
***
03  
Even the smallest part of the physical structure, a brick, the mortar between two bricks, the joint of one piece of wood with another, also has this living character <!-- 3 -->.

What process can accomplish the subtle and beautiful adaptation of the parts that will create a living architecture? In a certain sense, the answer is simple. We have to make — or generate — the ten thousand living centers in the building, one by one. That is the core fact. And the ten thousand centers, to be living centers, must be beautifully adapted to one another within the whole: each must fit the others, each must contribute to the others, and the ten thousand centers then — if they are truly living — must form a coherent and harmonious whole.  

It is generally assumed that doing all this well is the proper work of an architect. This is what an architect is supposed to do. It is what an architect is trained to do. And — in theory — it is what an architect knows how to do. There is a general belief that _how_ it is done by the architect and others is part of the mystery of the art; one does not ask too many questions about it.  Questions about _how_ it is best done—by what process – are rarely raised. Yet in this book I shall argue that careful thought about the adaptation problem shows that it _can_ only be done successfully, when following a certain very _particular_ kind of process. This does not mean that there is one ideal process which must be used. There are many thousands of different processes which can succeed. But to succeed, these processes must meet definite conditions — defined in the chapters which follow. Processes which meet these conditions, even though there may be thousands of them, are limited. They are rare and precious, compared with the millions upon millions of processes which are used daily for conceiving, designing, and building by architects and builders all over the world.

Many of the processes used today, sadly, are nearly _bound_ to fail. We see the results of this failure all around us. The lifeless buildings and environments which have become common in modern society are not merely dead, non-living, structures. They are what they are precisely because of the social _processes_ by which they have been conceived, designed, built, and paid for. No matter how skillful the architects, no matter how gifted, no matter how profound their powers of design – if the process used is wrong, the design cannot save the project.

 Thus we shall see that processes (both of design and of construction) are more important, and larger in their effect on the quality of buildings, than the ability or training of the architect. _Processes_ play a more fundamental role in determining the life or death of the building than does the “_design_”<!-- 4 -->.

## 3/ ORDER AS BECOMING

In many sciences, it has become commonplace to consider process as an inescapable part of order. In physics, for example, forces themselves are now seen as processes, and the structure we observe in the world of atoms and electrons is known to come about as a result of the continuous play of subatomic processes defined by quantum mechanics <!-- 5 -->. In biology, the structure of an organism is understood to be inseparable from the process which creates and maintains it: an animal, at any instant, is the ongoing result of certain genetically controlled processes which create the organism to begin with, and which continue to create that organism throughout its life. A cloud is a transitory by-product of the condensation of water in the atmosphere. The waves of the ocean are the flowing product of the process of interaction between wind and water.
***
04  
The sand ripples in the Sahara are the product of the process by which the wind takes sand, picks it up, and drops it. The mountain is the temporary product of the folding and heaving of the earth. The flower is the temporary product of the unfolding of the bud and seed pod under the driving influence of DNA. In each case, the whole system of order we observe is only an instantaneous cross section, in time, of a continuous and ongoing process of flux and change.

These insights originated 2,500 years ago with Heraclitus and his assertion that we can never step into the same river twice. But arriving at this understanding in modern science has been a difficult affair. D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, describing the origins of biological form in 1917 as a necessary result of biological growth, had to struggle intellectually, showing again and again by example that biological form could only be understood as a product of the growth process<!-- 6 -->.

Much more recently, the physicist Ilya Prigogine took decades, and many books and papers, to show that physics must be understood as a directional process –– and that the way classical physics viewed phenomena without the orientation of time was fundamentally at odds with reality and was incapable, therefore, of describing some of the most important physical phenomena. As Prigogine wrote in 1980: “_in classical physics change is nothing but a denial of becoming and time is only a parameter, unaffected by the transformation that it describes._”<!-- 7 -->

Now, at the turn into the 21st century, the “process” insight has finally arrived in most scientific disciplines. Gradually, a modern view has come into focus where we understand that it is the transformations from moment to moment which govern order in a system.   

However, despite the great progress made in many sciences and humanities, the concept of process has not yet become a normal part of the way we think about architecture. The words Prigogine used in 1980, criticizing mainstream 20th-century physics, could still be applied equally to contemporary mainstream architecture. _Our current view of architecture rests on too little awareness of becoming as the most essential feature of the building process._ Architects are much too concerned with the design of the world (its static structure), and not yet concerned enough with the design of the generative processes that create the world (its dynamic structure).

## 4/ PROCESS, THE KEY TO MA KING LIFE IN THINGS

I think of my friend Bill McClung making his meadows in the hills of Berkeley<!-- 9 -->. The near-wasteland of brush and eucalyptus, an overgrown and damaged landscape on the fringes of Berkeley becomes under his hand, something beautiful, alive.

Day after day, he goes up, gathers wood.  He cuts poison oak and brush and thorn. He mows grassland, takes out bushes which have overgrown, takes out a tree which prevents another tree from having the light, from having its magnificence. He makes a pathway where I can walk, where he can walk.

Gradually, by cutting and removing, with a careful eye, he forms meadow: patches of grassland where the light falls, bounded by trees, looking toward a landscape, looking out toward the bay.

From something nearly destroyed, beautiful patches of land are formed. He clears the land of that scrub which makes the land too vulnerable to fire.  He opens it, concentrates its beauty. Under the hand of this embellishment, each part becomes better; its uniqueness is preserved; its character　intensified.  

When he is done, each meadow has a different character. Each is ordinary, but a jewel, an individual jewel.The fabric of the jewel-like living meadows all together, if he succeeds, will cover the ridge of the Berkeley hills.

When I ask him what makes him keep doing it, he answers, “The knowledge that I am making life: that something living is being enhanced. That keeps us inspired. It makes it worthwhile. It is a tremendous thing.”

But then I ask him, pushing, “Isn't it really more the actual pleasure of each day? You go, and go again, because each day, each hour, is satisfying. It is simple work. You enjoy the sunshine, the open air, the physical sweat of carrying, and cutting. The smell of the grass as it opens up, the dog running in the grass, the comments of the neighbors." And there is also the feeling of community, as people living near this bit of park begin to recognize Bill as a fixture, hope that he will keep on coming back; they appreciate what he does. His act makes him part of a community. And most of all, it is just pleasant, worth living for. The hours and minutes spent are rewarding in themselves.

I ask him if this pleasure in the process he is following is not worth almost more than the knowledge that he is making something come to life? He acknowledges my comment and admits, “Yes, this daily ordinary thing is almost more important than the other.”  

But it is the two together: the daily pleasure, breathing in the smell of the newly cut grass, with the deeper knowledge that goes with it that in this process he is making a living structure, up there on the ridge of the Berkeley hills. Structure-preserving transformation unfolded to this point.

On the other hand, processes which work against the existing life of a place, which fragment it, ignore it, cut across it, do damage. Even when they only _ignore_ the wholeness or defy it with the best intentions, damage is done, disorder begins to occur. And as we watch the progress of the world, its growth, its change, we find that various acts –– coming either from outside or from inside the thing itself — may be helpful or unhelpful to this wholeness which exists. This happens because the wholeness of any given thing may be helped or hindered by the character of the parts which it contains.

Once we recognize the possibility that some centers will be helpful to the life of an existing wholeness, while others will be antagonistic to it, we then begin to recognize the possibility of a highly complex kind of self-consistency in any given wholeness.

>A 15th-century Hispano-Moresque tile, made by the cuerda seca technique, the use of rope to form the lines

The various centers within a wholeness may be in harmony with one another in different degrees, or at odds with one another in different degrees. And this is where the degree of life, or degree of value, in any given thing comes from.  

Thus we see that each given wholeness has a certain history: the wholeness becomes more valuable if the history allows this wholeness to unfold in a way that is considerate, respectful, of the existing structure, and less valuable if the steps which are taken in the emergence of the wholeness are antagonistic to the existing structure.  

What is fascinating, then, is the hint of a conception of value which emerges dynamically from respect for existing structure. We do not need any arbitrary or external criterion of value. The value exists within the unfolding of the wholeness itself. When the wholeness unfolds unnaturally, value is destroyed. When the wholeness unfolds naturally, value is created.

That is the origin of living structure.

Look at this Hispano-Moresque tile of the 15th century. When we first look at it, we see a beautiful design, harmonious, orderly, well conceived, beautiful space and color. In contemporary terms, all this would appear to be part of the design of the tile, since it is the geometry of the finished tile, it seems to us, that causes this. We think of its beauty as a result of design.

But when I handled this tile, looked at its surface, held its weight, looked at the glaze, and started to ask myself how I would make a tile like this, the thing took on quite a different character. I saw that the particular lines of the design are formed by raised ridges in the clay. The separate colors of the different glazes are kept separate by these ridges, so that the liquid glaze, at the temperature of the kiln, cannot “run.” As I thought more about how to do it— if I were actually making such a tile–I began to see that the sharp, almost hard design, the brilliant separation of glazes which makes the colors beautiful, and even the design itself, the character of straightness, curvature, and the formal quality of the line, are all by-products of a particular kind of process which must be used to make such a tile.

07  
>San-ju-san Gen Do, temple of the thirty-three bays, Kyoto, 13th century. Here, too, the beauty of this building, the wonderful harmony of its construction, arise as value that appears in the process of craft, from a gently unfolding wholeness. The unfolding of the woodwork is so complex, and yet so pure, that it reaches great spiritual depths.

I believe the design was made by laying thick rope into the soft clay. It is the _rope_ which allowed the maker form such complex shapes, with perfect parallel lines, and perfect half-round troughs. In my studio my assistant went further to understand how it had been done, and made a clay impression of the tile's surface in reverse. This reverse –– a raised embossed impression taken in modeling clay –– was even more impressive, and more beautiful than the tile itself. I realized that this — the negative impression — must have been the actual thing which the maker made, and that the tile was then cast from it in clay.

The further I went to understand the actual process which had been used to make the tile, the more I realized that it was this _process_, more than anything, which governs the beauty of the design. Perhaps nine-tenths of its character, its beauty, comes simply from the process that the maker followed. The design, what we nowadays think of as the design, followed.

>Interior, San-ju-san Gen Do, Kyoto. The interior is empty, except for one thousand golden Buddhas, carved, carefully placed, and revered.

***
08  
It was almost a residue from the all-important process. The design is indeed beautiful, yes. But it can only be made as beautiful as it is within the technique, or process, used to make it. And once one uses this technique, the design — what appears as the sophisticated beauty of the design — follows almost without thinking, just as a result of following the process.

If you do not use this technique — process — you cannot create a tile of this design. An attempt to follow the same drawing, but with different techniques, will fall flat on its face. And if I change the technique (process), then the design must change, too. This design follows almost without effort from this _technique_. It is the process, not the design, that is doing all the hard work, and which is even paving the way for the design.  

Thus the making, the physical processes of shaping, carving, drying, glazing, and firing the tile, are the ways in which this tile gets its form, its life, even its design. The “design” of this beautiful work is not more than a tenth of what gives it its life. Nine-tenths come from the process. We see the same phenomenon in a far more complex work from 13th-century Kyoto. In San-ju-san Gen Do, the temple of the thirty-three bays, we see the imprint of years, the imprint of care in the pieces of wood that have been lovingly matched to their position so well that seven hundred years later they still impress the heart. It is the mark of the plane on the wood which makes the wood, hundreds of years later, touch our hearts. It is the process used by the temple priests to lay out the foundations and cornerstones which places the building so beautifully in the land. It is the care of the goldsmith — the carving process and the carving tools, the process of making the mold — which gives each of the one thousand buddhas its unique personality, yet allows it to be ultimately the same and so, capable of teaching us, through one thousand manifestations, that we feel the true nature of all things.

This gradual rubbing together of phenomena to get the right result, the slow process of getting things right, is almost unknown to us today.

### 5/ OUR MECHANIZED PROCESS

During the 20th century, we became used to something very different.  

Consider the “normal” building process we have become used to in recent decades. A client specifies a program in which building areas are mechanically set out as requirements. In the case of a large building, this program is then made more precise (and often more rigid) by a professional programmer who sets it forth arithmetically in a table of square footages. An architect designs the building at a drawing table and is held to the program, rigidly, not to the evolving whole. The drawings are then checked by an engineer who is separate from the process and responsible for making the building stand up. A soils engineer very possibly works out the foundation, separately again. The final engineering drawings are then checked by a building inspector and by a zoning officer — again a separate process. In many cases, the zoning officer who checks them has not been to the site. Even if the officer has done a site visit, he or she has little or no authority to create any coherent relation between the building and the site, in relation to the site's special conditions. Once the drawings are approved, they are sent out to bid, by a contractor who has not been part of the design process, looks only at the drawings, but shares none of the vision. The drawings are also checked by a bank. The individual parts of the drawings may be sent out to bid by subcontractors, who are even more remote from the task at hand. Many of the objects, components, which will be used in the construction of the building are factory-made.
***
09  
They have been designed and constructed with no knowledge of the building at all; they are mentally and factually separate from its existence, but are brought into play only by a process of assembly.

During the building process, corrections cannot be made without huge expense to the client. Thus the assembly process is insensitive to almost any new wholeness which appears during construction. The landscape work is done by a separate architect, who specializes in plants. The actual gardening — that is, the preparation of the ground, planting of trees, flowers — is done by yet another person acting under orders, and once again contractually removed from the human feeling, light, and action of the building.

The interior, very often, is done by yet _another_ person — an interior decorator. This person, _again_ remote from any previous reality, will also assemble pre-constructed components and modules to try and produce a whole. But the elements are, at the end, almost inevitably separate and cold in feeling, harsh in content, without origin in human meaning. They do not reflect the feelings of the building's occupants; nor do they arise naturally from the wholeness of the building shell and from the seeds of a direction which that shell already contains. Even the building's paint is often applied as an afterthought, as if it were an independent act. And the very paint, itself, is once again chosen from among a system of mechanically component-like colors, none of which was conceived in the context of the building, but which exist, precooked, in a catalog.

Present-day town-planning practice — mainly based on zoning — is equally mechanical in character. It is largely independent of the people most directly affected, and is controlled by appointed officials, who often do not even visit the site where a particular building is to be built. The zoning ordinance — a map of an imaginary future, used as a control device — is prepared by others. The process is based, in considerable part, on the needs of the developer-controlled, profit-oriented marketplace, and on the assumption that agreement about deep value is impossible in principle. Achievement of subtle or spiritual character in a town under these conditions — which are a large-scale replica of the conditions surrounding smaller-scale mechanical building process — is once again hardly possible.  

You might say of these examples, “But this surely is all process. Isn't that good?” The trouble is that it is _mechanical_ process only, something which subverts the inner fire of true living process.

In a mechanistic view of the world, we see all things, even if only for convenience, as machines. A machine is intended to accomplish something. It is, in its essence, goal-oriented. Like machines, then, within a mechanistic view processes are always seen as aimed at certain ends. We think of things by the end-state we want, and then ask ourselves how to get there.

This mistake was widespread in the 20th century. For example, in the extreme 20th century view of some mechanistic sociology, even kindness might have been seen as a way of achieving certain results: part of a bargain, or a social contract, which had the purpose of _getting_ something<!-- 10 -->.

Real kindness is something quite different, something valuable in _itself_. It is a true process, not guided by the grasp for a goal, but guided by the minute-to-minute necessity of caring, dynamically, for the feelings and well-being of another. This is not trivial, but deep; sincerely related to human feeling; and not predictable in its end-result, because the end-result is not a goal. Unlike the goal-oriented picture, which is imposed intellectually on our substance as persons, real kindness is a process true to our essential human instinct and to our knowledge of what it means to be a person. But the machine-age view showed a process like kindness as being oriented toward a _goal_, just as every machine too has its purpose — its goal, what it is intended to produce.

Like the mechanical 20th-century view of kindness, the 20th-century mainstream view of building was goal-oriented and mechanistic, aimed mainly at end-results, not on the inner good of processes.

***
12  
Building was viewed as a necessary way to achieve a certain end-result. The design drawn by the architect — the master plan drawn by the planner — was the purpose, these were the goals of the art. The process of getting to the goal was thought to be of little importance in itself, except insofar as it attained (or failed to attain) the desired goal.

The mechanistic view of architecture we have learned to accept in our era is crippled by this overly-simple, goal-oriented approach. In the mechanistic view of architecture we think mainly of _design_ as the desired end-state of a building, and far too little of the _way_ or _process_ of making a building as something inherently beautiful in itself. But, most important of all, the background underpinning of this goal-oriented view — a static world almost without process — just is not a truthful picture. As a conception of the world, it roundly fails to describe things as they are. It exerts a crippling effect on our view of architecture and planning because it fails to be true to ordinary, everyday fact. For in fact, everything is constantly changing, growing, evolving. The human body is changing. Trees bear leaves, and the leaves fall. The road cracks. People's lives change from week to week. The building moves with wind and rain and movement of the earth. Buildings and streets and gardens are modified constantly while they are inhabited, sometimes improved, sometimes destroyed. Towns are created as a cooperative flow caused by hundreds, even millions, of people over time.

Why is this process-view essential? Because the ideals of “design,” the corporate boardroom drawing of the imaginary future, the developer's slick watercolor perspective of the future end-state, control our conception of what must be done — yet they bear no relation to the actual nature, or problems, or possibilities, of a living environment. And they are socially backward, since they necessarily diminish people's involvement in the continuous creation of their world.

In all this, _process_ is still not present as something essential, only as something mechanical <!-- 11 -->. In our profession of architecture there is no conception, yet, of process _itself_ as a budding, as a flowering, as an unpredictable, unquenchable unfolding through which the future grows from the present in a way that is dominated by the goodness of the moment.

### 6/ POSSIBILITY OF A NEW VIEW OF ARCHITECTURAL PROCESS

I shall argue that every good process in architecture, and in city planning also, treats the world as a whole and allows every action, every process, to appear as an unfolding of that whole. When living structure is created, what is to be built is made consistent with the whole, it comes from the whole, it nourishes and protects the whole.

We may get some inkling of this kind of thing by considering what it means to _design_ a building, and to compare it with what it means to _make_ a building. Naively, I make a building if I actually do it myself, do it with my own hands. This sounds like fun. But of course that is impossible for all but the very smallest buildings. More deeply, what it means for me to _make_ a building is that I am totally responsible for it. I am actually responsible for its structure, its materials, its functioning, its safety, its cost, its beauty, everything. This is in marked contrast with the present idea of architecture, where as an architect I am definitely not responsible for everything. I am only responsible for my particular part in the process, for my set of drawings, which will then function, within the system, in a strictly limited fashion that is shut off from the whole.
***
13  
I have limited responsibility. Like a bureaucrat, I play my role, but “don’t ask me to be responsible for anything-I am just doing my job.”

When I _make_ something, on the other hand, I am deeply involved with it and responsible for it. And not only I. Whether I am head of some project, or a person making some small part of it, the feeling of total responsibility is on my shoulders. In a good process, each person working on the building is — and feels — responsible for everything. For design, schedule, structure, flowers, feeling-everything.

I remember a few years ago meeting an old man who told me he had put the last I-beam on the Empire State Building. He had also placed the highest steelwork on the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge. As he told me about the riveters and welders he used to work with, he described a kind of special ethic they carried with them: while doing their work, five hundred or a thousand feet above the ground, they were conscious, among themselves, that whatever they did — every rivet, every weld — was their responsibility and theirs alone. It was up to them to make a thing that was to last forever. It was in their hands, and there　were no excuses.

This was vastly removed from the “I-am just-doing-my-job” attitude which exists in the fragmented and mechanical process most often followed today, where the demarcation of responsibility is socially and legally drawn to make sure each person does _not_ feel responsible for the whole.

I do not suggest that making should be reintroduced for reasons of nostalgia. But I shall prove that a process which is not based on making in a holistic sense, _cannot create a living structure_. And I shall demonstrate hyper modern processes, many using the most advanced techniques of the present and of the future, in which a new form of _making_ dominates our attitude.

In every sphere of nature, and in every sphere of human effort, there are trillions upon trillions of possible processes. Of these trillions, only a few are _living_ processes — that is, actually capable of generating living structure. That does not mean that living processes are rare. There are, of course, still billions of them among the trillions. All the processes which generate nature – including what we understand as physics, chemistry, biology, geomorphology, hydrodynamics – they are _all_ living processes, because they do virtually all generate living structure, at least most of the time. However, there is an even larger number of _possible_ processes which fail to create living structure.  

Since human beings are the first creatures on Earth who have managed to create non-living structure, the need to focus on non-living processes is new.  Indeed, we have only even _seen_ non-living structure and non-living process for the first time in relatively recent decades.

Traditional society almost never saw these non-living processes. Although traditional society was filled with human-created processes — human-inspired and human-invented — it was dominated by living process. Human beings in traditional societies, by and large, used living processes.

Non-living process is a recent arrival on the planet Earth. It is only in the modern era, and chiefly in the last 50-100 years, that human beings have given widespread use to processes of all kinds which are non-living, which therefore generate quantities of non-living structure.

However, since the distinction between living process and non-living process has now become visible, and since, for the time being, we have no precise conception or definition of living process, it has become urgent that we try to get one.

In this book I make an effort, perhaps for the first time, to make this distinction and to lay a basis for a theory — and for a form of daily practice — which allows for a world in which living process, hence living structure, dominates the world and its creation.

8. I am aware of one provocative counter-example, in the following passage by a philosopher, Bruno Pinchard: “It is on the subject of architecture that Aristotle achieves great precision in the presentation of his dynamics, when he analyzes the reality of the buildable as such and distinguishes it from the finished construction. Now the architecture is not only in the house that is built, but in the act of building itself. The mover in architecture is not only the mental image of the project in the architect's mind. Particularly for the great theorists of Vitruvian humanist architecture, who tried hard not to reduce the origins of architecture to the primitive hut, it is the architect's job to direct work on the site and so to transform the plan according to the necessities of the climate of the materials at his disposal. This amounts to drawing a distinction between the idea of the house and its form, its programming and the carrying out of the opus. In other words, the architect's final cause is not simple (the architect is not just a space technician), and it may be said that there is no classical architecture that does not carry in its realization the trace of the processes of its construction.” From Bruno Pinchard, Appendix to René Thom's SEMIophysics, A SKETCH (Boston: Addison Wesley, 1990), pp. 237-38.
